# feeless - A Nano Cryptocurrency node, wallet, tools, and Rust library.

**‚ö† This is a work in progress. It's not ready to use as a real node! ‚ö†**

As a personal adventure into understanding Nano, I decided to write a Nano node in Rust. The original implementation is
in C++. I give no promises about my future motivation to complete this project ü§ê.

## What is Nano?

**Nano** is a decentralized money that is significantly improves on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The main features of **Nano** are:

* No transaction fees.
* Extremely fast to send @ less than 1 second. (Bitcoin takes at least 10 minutes.)
* Decentralized (as much as Bitcoin).
* No inflation.
* Significantly less energy use than Bitcoin.

Other names: Nano cryptocurrency, Nano coin, Rai Blocks.

For more information on what Nano is, see the Nano documentation: https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/

## Goals

### Rust crate

* A complete library that a Rust developer can use to manage wallets, keys, blocks.
* Compatibility with the JSON RPC server.

### Tooling

* A command line tool for particular actions, e.g. generating seeds, conversions between keys, addresses, etc.
* An RPC command line interface for the JSON RPC server.

### Nano node

* A functional node with as much business logic as I can understand from the C++ implementation.
* It has to perform well enough to help the network. I don't want Nano to slow down if people start using this! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* Correct Rebroadcasting rules
* Representative voting
* Bootstrapping

## Non-goals

* Only support protocol version 18+
* No UDP support
* No user interface
