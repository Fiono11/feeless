# ‚ã∞¬∑‚ã∞ Feeless

## What is Feeless?

**Feeless** is a **Nano** cryptocurrency node, wallet, tools, and Rust crate. This is not the official project for Nano,
only a reimplementation written in Rust. The official Nano node
implementation [lives here](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node).

‚ö† This is a work in progress. It's not ready to use as a real node! ‚ö†

I decided to start this project as a personal adventure into understanding Nano. I give no promises about my future
motivation to complete this project ü§ê.

## What is Nano?

**Nano** is a decentralized money that significantly improves on **Bitcoin** and other cryptocurrencies.

The main features of **Nano** are:

* No transaction fees.
* Extremely fast to send money--less than 1 second for 100% confirmation. (Bitcoin takes 10 minutes on average for
  ~80%<sup>1</sup> confirmation.)
* Decentralized (as much as Bitcoin).
* No inflation.
* Significantly less energy use than Bitcoin.

Other names: Nano cryptocurrency, Nano coin, Rai Blocks.

For more information on what Nano is, see the Nano documentation: https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/

<sup>
1. The Bitcoin white paper, under section 11 "Calculations" explains there's a ~80% chance for an attacker with 10%
   mining power to overtake the longest chain. (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

## Goals

### Rust crate

* A complete library that a Rust developer can use to handle wallets, keys, blocks, signing, proof of work, etc.

### Tools

* A command line tool for particular actions, e.g. generating seeds, conversions between keys, addresses, etc.
* A command line client for the official Nano RPC server.

### Nano node

* A functional Nano node with business logic from the official C++ implementation.
* Correct rebroadcasting rules
* Representative voting
* Bootstrapping
* It has to perform well enough to help the network. I don't want Nano to slow down if people start using this! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Non-goals

* Only support protocol version 18+
* No UDP support
* No user interface
